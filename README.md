# TarkovPlayerSearch

This is a simple batch script that allows you to view Escape from Tarkov player stats via a username input. The script uses the "https://tarkov.dev/" website to display the stats.

## How to Use

1. Run the batch script. A command prompt window titled "Tarkov PSearch" will open.
2. You will be prompted to "Enter the players username:". Type in the username of the player whose stats you want to view and press Enter.
3. The script will display "Tracking..." and then open your default web browser to the Tarkov.dev profile page of the entered username.
4. After the browser opens, the script will display "Completed!" and then prompt you again for a username. This process will repeat until you close the command prompt window.

## Have fun and catch some cheaters!
